fix: resolve root cause of deployment failures - comprehensive SSR fixes

- Replace simplified next.config.js with production-ready configuration
- Add PDF.js and Tesseract.js stubs to prevent SSR worker issues  
- Fix window/document/performance API access with proper SSR guards
- Add webpack ignore plugins for worker files and problematic modules
- Preserve all enterprise functionality while ensuring SSR compatibility

This addresses the root cause: Next.js 15 + heavy libraries causing SSR failures.
