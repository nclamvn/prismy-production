## Pricing Configuration

### Vietnamese Pricing Strategy

The system uses these VND equivalents (based on current exchange rates):

- **Standard Plan**: 239,000 VND/month (~$9.99 USD)
- **Premium Plan**: 719,000 VND/month (~$29.99 USD)
- **Enterprise Plan**: 2,399,000 VND/month (~$99.99 USD)

### Price Considerations for Vietnamese Market

1. **Psychological Pricing**: Rounded to common Vietnamese price points
